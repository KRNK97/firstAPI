# first API (FLASK-RESTFUL)

This is my first time creating an 'API' of any sort. I used the Flask-restful module to implement it.
The data is stored in just a python list in this basic application!

### Packages/ Technologies Used
 - Flask as the frame work
 - Fask-restful for API
 
 ### API Usage
 ```
 
- /products                                 => Get All Products
- /add/(product name,type,price,quantity)   => Add New Product
- /delete/(id)                              => Delete A Product by id
- /product/(id)                             => Get A Product by id

```
